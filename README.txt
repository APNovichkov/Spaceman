This is a game that mirrors Hangman.

You get as many strikes as there are letters in the secret word that we pick randomly from
the words.txt file.

If you guess a letter wrong, you will get a 1 subtracted from total tries.
If you guess a letter right, you will see it get printed on instead of the underscore.

If you run out of strikes, you lose the game.
If you guess the word, you win the game!

In each case, you will get asked to play again.

Have fun! Happy guessing :)
